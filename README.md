*A DNA-encoded cryptographic hasher with devilish security.*  

Hashes text/files into **unbreakable A/T/G/C sequences** using SHA-512 + XOR + genetic shuffling.  

## 🛠️ Installation

***Python 3.6 or Python 3.6+***

    git clone https://github.com/ddnizrozee/devild_hasher.git
    cd devild-hasher

## 🧬 Usage

### 🧬 Encoding

    python3 devild-hasher.py

After you run devild-hasher.py;

 Press 1 to Devil Hash a text.

 Press 2 to Devil Hash a .txt file.

If you press 1, just put the text and your text will be Devil Hashed.

If you press 2, you have to put the file directory of the .txt file you want to Devil Hash. 

e.g. (After you press 2)

    /home/kali/Downloads/secret_stuff.txt

Output saves to encoded_output.txt

***!DON'T FORGET THE SAVE THE KEY AFTER ENCODING THE TEXT SINCE YOU'LL NEED THE KEY TO DECODE IT!***

### 🧬 Decoding

    python3 devild_decoder.py

After you run **devild_decoder.py**, write the path to your .txt file storing the encoded text (in this case ***encoded_output.py***)

Then put the key you saved from the encoding session.

Boom!
